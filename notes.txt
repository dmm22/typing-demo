Yes, there is a generally accepted best practice order for imports in React to keep your code organized and readable. Here is the commonly recommended order:

React-related imports: Import React and related hooks or utilities first.
Third-party library imports: Import any libraries from node_modules.
Alias or absolute imports: Imports that use aliases or absolute paths.
Relative imports: Imports from your own codebase, ordered by:
Components
Contexts
Hooks
Utilities/helpers
Types/interfaces
Styles



Yes, it is a common practice to put line breaks between different types of imports to improve readability and maintainability of the code. This makes it easier to quickly distinguish between various categories of imports, such as React-related imports, third-party libraries, and different parts of your own codebase.


Yes, there are generally accepted best practices for the order in which you add hooks, context, and state to your React components. Following a consistent order helps in maintaining readability and organization of the component's code.

Recommended Order:
State Hooks: Start with useState and other state-related hooks.
Context Hooks: Include useContext next to handle context values.
Ref Hooks: Add useRef for creating references to DOM elements or mutable values.
Effect Hooks: Use useEffect to handle side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or updating the DOM.
Memoization Hooks: Place useMemo and useCallback for performance optimization.
Custom Hooks: Include any custom hooks you have created, which might use a combination of the above hooks.


When it comes to ordering attributes in JSX, it's generally best to follow a consistent and logical order to improve readability and maintainability. While there is no official best practice, the following order is commonly recommended:

key: If present, always place the key attribute first.
ref: Place the ref attribute next, if present.
className / style: Follow with className and style attributes for styling.
id / name: Then, include id and name attributes.
Standard HTML attributes: Include other standard HTML attributes (like type, value, src, alt, etc.).
Event handlers: Place event handlers (like onChange, onClick, onKeyDown, etc.) next.
Custom attributes: Finally, add any custom attributes or props.
